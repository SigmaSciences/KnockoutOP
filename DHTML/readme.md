### DHTML v4.5 Patch Files

This folder contains patch files for:

- htclasses.pas
- htmldraw.pas

**Note:** Any required changes to the DHTML files will be updated after the next DHTML release, although hopefully we can eventually dispense with these patches.

There are patches generated using BeyondCompare Pro v4 (since that's what I normally use) in the BeyondCompare folder. Note that you'll need to edit the patch files with your own file paths (see the first line).

I'm not sure what other patching options are available for users that don't have the BeyondCompare Pro version. If you'd like alternative patches uploaded then just email me with the URL of the tool plus **a full description** of the steps required to generate and apply patches. This of course assumes it's a non-commercial tool.
